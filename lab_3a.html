                CANNES, France — The apocalypse arrived early at the Cannes Film Festival. 
                In “The Dead Don’t Die,” the latest from Jim Jarmusch and this year’s opening 
                selection, catastrophe takes the form of zombies, who rise from their graves 
                to destroy the living. It’s the end of the world as we know it, which Jarmusch 
                reminds us, is entirely our fault. “Polar fracking” has thrown Earth off its 
                axis and now Iggy Pop is gnawing on innards that (this being a Jarmusch joint) 
                he washes down with coffee.
                The 72nd festival has a similarly admirable energy and staying power. 
                Despite a decline in moviegoing in Europe and the global embrace of streaming, 
                Cannes remains a proud monument to the theatrical experience. It’s holding firm 
                even if this year’s edition seems slightly less jammed than in the past, which 
                may have something to do with the intense security. Heavily armed police and soldiers 
                patrol the area around the festival’s headquarters, a reminder of security measures 
                instituted after a series of terrorist attacks.
                But on Tuesday, opening night, as Michael Jackson blared on loudspeakers 
                (Cannes can be very tin-eared in its choices), all eyes and innumerable cameras 
                were on the red carpet, where Jarmusch’s stars — Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, Adam 
                Driver, Selena Gomez — paraded under a gray sky. Inside, they and the rest of the 
                audience endured a ceremony that threatened to drag on as long as the Oscars. The 
                host inanely prattled; a singer warbled; movie clips were screened; and the main jury, 
                headed by the Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu, took a bow.
