      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> My name is Mira Kasari and I am currently a 
        Junior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
        I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree with a double major in Computer Science B.A. and Communications Studies 
        with a New Media track. 
        <br> <br>
        I have always been interested in a field with computers, and being creative, I was 
        excited to learn that there was a creative field in computer science that allowed me to 
        explore my own creative abilites on the computer.

      <h2>Tennis</h2>
      <P>I have been playing tennis since I was eight years old. 
        In high school, I played all four years, and was captain during my senior year 
        of our Women's Tennis Team. 
        Now, at UNC, I play on the Club Tennis Team. 
        My family is a tennis family so everytime I go home, I play tennis.
      </P>

      <h2>Photography</h2>
      <p> Photography has been a hobby of mine for only about a year now.
        When I studied abroad in India, I realized that I wanted to document my
        experience through pictures, and started teaching myself how to use the camera
        and different techniques.

      <h2>Modeling</h2>
      <p> I started modeling when I was in high school. 
        I was scouted in the airport, and decided to give it a try. 
        I am now signed with Directions USA, an agency in the southern  region, 
        and have done many works, including Belk commercials and magazine covers.
