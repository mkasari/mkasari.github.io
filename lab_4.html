        <p> I really enjoyed this website because of the layout. 
            He has his portfolio on the very first page you enter. 
            Each picture is clickable, so that the user can look at one image at a time, or all of them at once. 
            He also has tabs in the top right corner that link to different pages of his website. 
            His blog consists of a list of several links that navigate to different pages. 
            I like how minimalist and clean this website is. 
            Everything is easily accessible and easy to read, and as a photography blog, 
            his work is the focus.
