                        <p>
                                One of the main protagonists of the show and owner 
                                of "Bob's Burgers". He is the husband to Linda and 
                                father to Tina, Gene, and Louise. He is a third generation 
                                restaurateur and is 47 years old. Bob was born to an unnamed 
                                mother and Big Bob who ran a diner called "Big Bob's Diner". 
                                Bob had a relatively unhappy childhood as his mother died when 
                                he was young and his father was an alcoholic who forced Bob to 
                                constantly work. He is also known to never smile. Bob is the more 
                                sensible one of the bunch though he isn't afraid to get petty and 
                                is often stubborn and exasperated. Despite his somewhat pessimistic 
                                personality, he loves and cares for his family very much as well as 
                                his restaurant.

                                    One of the main protagonists of the show and wife to Bob 
                                    and mother to Tina, Gene, and Louise. She is fun-loving and 
                                    happy-go-lucky, a positive contrast to her husband's pessimism. 
                                    Linda is generally laid back and obliviously enthusiastic in 
                                    whatever she does. Linda is shown to be very supportive, but 
                                    can be strict as well, showing less leniency when Louise 
                                    doesn't listen to her.

                                        The eldest of the three Belcher children, is 
                                        socially awkward and insecure, and tends to freeze 
                                        up when faced with any sort of decision. She is like 
                                        many teenage girls, fantasizing over her crushes and a 
                                        fan of boy bands such as "Boyz 4 Now". She likes horses, 
                                        rainbows, butts, zombies, writing erotic fiction, and movies. 
                                        Tina has a massive crush on Jimmy Pesto (Bob's rival)'s son, 
                                        Jimmy Jr., who vacillates between reciprocating and rejecting 
                                        Tina's affections. She is a hopeless romantic and writes various 
                                        fanfiction about Jimmy Jr. and her life. Out of the three 
                                        siblings, Tina is arguably the most responsible, although 
                                        Gene and Louise take advantage of her innocence and naivete.

                                            mother, Gene is carefree and friendly. Gene enjoys pestering 
                                            everyone around him by using sound effects with either his 
                                            keyboard or megaphone. He frequently records fart sounds and 
                                            uses them as sound effects and additions to his music. He is

                                            often helping her with schemes. Gene has shown to have passion 
                                            for music and music business but, as he is 11, has been shown 
                                            to have trouble committing to putting the work into learning 
                                            the technique behind music. Despite this, he has written at

                                            ranging from farts to Thanksgiving.

                                The youngest Belcher at 9 years old, is a schemer with a mischievous and 
                                cynical personality. She is often yelling or screeching. Though her 
                                intentions in the series consistently appear to be dubious, she is 
                                often portrayed as a reluctant antihero. She is also narcissistic in 
                                nature and is very manipulative. Louise is protective of and has a deep 
                                affection for her family, though she displays her feelings towards each 
                                in different fashions. She looks up to her father somewhat, but she is 
                                not above manipulating him when it suits her. Her relationship with her 
                                mother is more complex, and Louise is more likely to disobey her mother 
                                than her father. Louise always wears a pink bunny hat, with her uncovered 
                                head yet to be seen.
