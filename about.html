                       <p>The show centers on the Belcher family – 
                           Bob, Linda, and their children Tina, Gene, and 
                           Louise. The family runs a burger restaurant on 
                           Ocean Avenue in an unnamed seaside community 
                           (informally known as "Seymour's Bay" among the 
                           show's writing staff). While series creator 
                           Loren Bouchard has said that the show's location 
                           was an indeterminate Northeastern United States 
                           shore town (calling the setting a "semi-Springfield)",
                           some critics, particularly after the episode 
                           "It Snakes a Village", have deduced that the unidentified 
                           setting appears to actually be southern New Jersey.

                            Bob's Burgers is located in a green two-story building 
                            which features an apartment on the second floor where the 
                            Belcher family lives. The restaurant is sandwiched between 
                            two other commercial buildings, one of which houses "It's 
                            Your Funeral Home and Crematorium". As a running gag, the 
                            other building is shown in the opening credits to be a new 
                            business each week, often with names which are elaborate puns.
                            <br><br>
                            Bob's Burgers has a few regulars – most frequently handman 
                            Teddy and Mort from the neighbouring crematorium. The 
                            restaurant has to compete with several other local eateries 
                            for business. His biggest rival is Jimmy Pesto, who owns an 
                            Italian restaurant called "Jimmy Pesto's Pizzeria", which is 
                            located directly across the street and is generally more 
                            successful, creating tension between the two owners.
                            <br><br>
                            As well as assisting in the restaurant, the Belcher children 
                            all attend Wagstaff school. Several episode plot lines involve 
                            the children's escapades in and out of school. 13-year old Tina, 
                            at the beginning of adolescence, struggles with her attraction 
                            to boys. The most common target for her affections is Pesto's 
                            eldest son, Jimmy Junior.
                            <br><br>
                            Episodes will sometimes involve a single storyline involving 
                            all of the Belchers, or will have two simultaneous stories for 
                            different groups of the family. The family members interact with 
                            many recurring characters who are also residents of the town.

                            Bob's Burgers makes occasional use of musical numbers. The 
                            closing sequence uses different soundtracks each episode, and, 
                            from season two, a different animation played alongside the credits..</p>
