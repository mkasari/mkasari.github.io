    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> My name is Mira Kasari and I am currently a 
        Junior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
        I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree with a double major in Computer Science B.A. and Communications Studies 
        with a New Media track. 
        <br> <br>
        I have always been interested in a field with computers, and being creative, I was 
        excited to learn that there was a creative field in computer science that allowed me to 
        explore my own creative abilites on the computer.

      <h2>Tennis</h2>
      <P >I have been playing tennis since I was eight years old. 
          In high school, I played all four years, and was captain during my senior year 
          of our Women's Tennis Team. 
          Now, at UNC, I play on the Club Tennis Team. 
          My family is a tennis family so everytime I go home, I play tennis.
