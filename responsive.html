              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p> My name is Mira Kasari and I am currently a 
                Junior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
                I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree with a double major in Computer Science B.A. and Communications Studies 
                with a New Media track. 
                <br> <br>
                I have always been interested in a field with computers, and being creative, I was 
                excited to learn that there was a creative field in computer science that allowed me to 
                explore my own creative abilites on the computer.

      <h2>Tennis</h2>
      <P >I have been playing tennis since I was eight years old. 
        In high school, I played all four years, and was captain during my senior year 
        of our Women's Tennis Team. 
        Now, at UNC, I play on the Club Tennis Team. 
        My family is a tennis family so everytime I go home, I play tennis.
